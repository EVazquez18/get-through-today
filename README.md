# get-through-today
This is a Python program that takes in user input as a way to cheer someone up after a difficult day. The user can select from various options by first telling the computer what they are feeling, and then suggesting some ways to cheer the user up. These include: self care suggestions, animal pictures, funny videos, reassuring memes, and words of encouragement. It uses a file system that accesses functions that generate the content from URLs in a random position in the array.
